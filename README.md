This is a calculator, I've done it as a university project. The main task of this work was to practice in the usage of Tkinter and to replace eval() function.

Also, this calculator gives an opportunity to work with constants, which is usefull when you do calculations with same values.

In addition, it can read the file and calculate expressions in it.
